When I had used/learned enough pygame(a python library),
I decided to enter a game jam in order to make a project.

I entered a two week Python Game Jam on itch.io.

Although I worked on the game very hard, and even made it in those two weeks,
I couldn't properly upload the files(since I have never uploaded on itch) and ended up not submitting.

After sometime I decided to make the screen sacalable(vary in size) and a mobile version(with on-screen button) aswell.
